## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` as template
   - Rotate secrets on team member departure

2. **Dependencies**
   - Run `make audit` before commits
   - Keep Node.js >= 22.12.0
   - Review `CHANGELOG.md` for security updates

3. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens are identity-only (no sensitive data)
   - Always verify token signature
   - Implement token revocation for logout

4. **Database**
   - Use parameterized queries ($1, $2, etc.)
   - Never interpolate user input
   - Implement row-level security (RLS) for multi-tenant data

### For Operations

1. **Deployment**
   - Enable HTTPS everywhere
   - Use Railway's secret management
   - Implement rate limiting at WAF level

2. **Monitoring**
   - Alert on failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor webhook signature failures
   - Track rate limit violations

## Third-Party Dependencies

All dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities using:

- `pnpm audit` (on every commit via Makefile)
- GitHub Advanced Security (continuous)
- Snyk (scheduled)
